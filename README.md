### Hi there :wave:

My name is Jan [[jan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jan#German)].

## Code snippets

I dislike the way GitHub gists are displayed and much prefer GitLab snippets, which have a designated title (not just the file name) and a Markdown-enabled description.
Have a look at some of [my snippets](https://gitlab.com/users/janniklasrose/snippets).

## Some of my GitHub statistics
