### Hi there :wave:

My name is Jan [[jan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jan#German)] :de:.

## Research

I obtained my PhD from Imperial College London in 2021 for my dissertation _Computational modelling of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging based on cardiac histology_.
The work was carried out at the Department of Aeronautics (who sponsored my PhD studies) in collaboration with the Royal Brompton Hospital, supported by a grant from the British Heart Foundation.

During my research I investigated and developed methods to create realistic virtual models of the microstructure of the myocardium (heart muscle).
I then used these models as input to numerial simulations of diffusion, to simulate in-vivo diffusion MRI experiments.
Most of my work is published here on GitHub, so feel free to browse my repositories.

## Code snippets

I dislike the way GitHub gists are displayed and much prefer GitLab snippets, which have a designated title (not just the file name) and a Markdown-enabled description.
Have a look at some of my [code snippets](https://gitlab.com/users/janniklasrose/snippets).
